## 1. Project Name  
**GoSafe**

## 2. Selected Paper Prototype  
For this project, we selected the **smartphone paper prototypes** instead of the smartwatch versions. We chose the smartphone format because it better suits the needs and interaction patterns of our application, which requires a larger interface, clearer visual elements, and more detailed user input capabilities.  

During the transition from paper prototypes to the digital version, we decided to **move features originally designed for the smartwatch prototype into the smartphone layout**. These features will be adapted by expanding their visual components and reorganizing the interface to take advantage of the increased screen space while maintaining ease of use and quick accessibility.

## 3. Interactive Prototype (Figma)  
Below are the publicly accessible links to the two screens of the interactive prototype (to be added):
